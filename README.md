# Rusticana

A simple restaurant page built with HTML, CSS3 and vanilla Javascript.

It has enough CSS to make it presentable as this was built to practice event handling and the creation of a tab-driven navigation bar using vanilla Javascript.

## Usage

### Requirements

- NodeJS
- NPM

Clone the repository and run:

`npm install`

NPM will install the packages needed to run the application. Once that's ready, simply run:

`npx webpack`

This will bundle the Javascript files needed. Once that's done, open the `index.html` file inside the `dist` directory with your regular web browser.
